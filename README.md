Hi there 👋

- Hi, I'm Gabriel Smith.
- I'm currently studying Computer Engineering.
- I chose my major because I want to design and build computer products.
- A fun fact about me is:  I played D1 baseball, before a quick stint as a semi-pro golfer. 
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I want to learn C and C++ programming.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Sicario.
